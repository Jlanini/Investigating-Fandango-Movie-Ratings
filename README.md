# Investigating-Fandango-Movie-Ratings
Fandago is an American ticketing company that sells movie tickets via their website as well as through their mobile app, as reported by Wikipedia. In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey published an article where he presents strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. In particular he found out a significant discrepancy between the number of stars, used in Fandago website to indicate the movie rate, and the actual rating, indicated in the HTML of the page. After this analysis Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug and that they were going to fix it. Nowadays it is not possible to evaluate whether the bag has been fixed or not since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.
The aim of this project is to investigate determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis. We are going to do it by comparing a datasets related to the film ratings of Fandango and other popular websites before and after Hickey's analysis.
